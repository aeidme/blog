Hello there and welcome to my blog! My name is Abdullatif Eid and I'm a machine learning and data engineer. My long-term interests are artificial intelligence, software engineering and large-scale process automation. I'm passionate about the things I do, especially building intelligent end-to-end automated systems using various concepts and technologies.

I've worked on a range of technical problems in many areas including but not limited to CV (computer vision), NLP (natural language processing), process automation, data analysis as well as building end-to-end machine learning workflows.

My technical stack mainly revolves around Python along its machine learning and deep learning libraries, cloud platforms (AWS, Azure and GCP), big data tools such as Spark and I'm always seeking to dive into other technologies when the necessity arises.
